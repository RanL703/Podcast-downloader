# Universal Podcasts Transcriber
Tired of searching for the right podcasts for you when your favourite podcasters are jumping from one political figure to a rock musician with every episode? Well, worry not! I got you!

Introducing my very own podcast search and transcribing assistant that helps you search and download the audio of right podcasts for you and even transcribe them for you! We are using pytube and youtube_search_api libraries for the searching part of the program and whisper for transcribing them all! I am using LLaMA3.1 through Ollama to take your queries and transform them into effective search queries for YouTube.
